        "## Monte Carlo Tree Search\n",
        "Monte Carlo Tree Search is the industry standard for complex games like Go and Chess. Combined with ConvNets, MCTS was used by Google in Alpha Go and Alpha Zero. In MCTS, the computer plays a number of games against itself. It generates its own expected value of each game state through trial and error, which eliminates the need to explore every state. The cost of this is non-optimality. As the computer simulates more games, it will learn which game states are favorable or unfavorable (more likely to result in a victory). In this section, you will implement Monte Carlo Tree Search for tic tac toe.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this activity, you will implement an adversarial version of MCTS to play the game of tic-tac-toe. For additional implementation details, refer to Cameron Browne's lecture on Monte Carlo Tree Search: ccg.doc.gold.ac.uk/ccg_old/teaching/ludic_computing/ludic16.pdf"
